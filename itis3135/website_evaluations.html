            <a href="https://www.lingscars.com"> Bad Website Example</a>
        </h3>
        <ul> 
            <li> 
                C: From my point of view in a contrast perspective, I believe this website is a bad example because 
                the colors are a bit too much and all over the place. Thus, making the website more unprofessional and 
                less persuasive for adversitement purposes.
                
            </li>
            <li> 
                R: From my point of view in a repititional perspective, I believe the GIF images are overly used and they 
                are unnecessary. This was not a good method of grasping the attention of the auidence in a good way. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                A: From my point of view in an alignment perspective, I believe this website is a bad example because the menu 
                on the website for nativagion is right aligned instead of centered which would have made the menu look proper. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                P: From my point of view in a proximity perspective, I believe this website is a bad representation mainly 
                becasue it is not consistent with the color and shapes of the objects represented within the website.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <ul> 
            <li> 
                C: From my point of view in a contrast perspective, I believe this website is a good example because the colors used
                on this website is not too bright or dull. The colors used make it easy for the audience to read all the information given 
                within the website. 
                
            </li>
            <li> 
                R: From my point of view in a repititional perspective,  I believe this website is a good example because it does not repeat 
                any unnecessary information. Instead, the consistency is great for the conveinence of the audience to keep up with all detailed 
                information within the NBA. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                A: From my point of view, from an alignment perspective, I believe the alignment is great! Everything is easy to navigate 
                through and nothing seems to be out of place.
            </li>
            <li> 
                P: From my point of view in a proximity perspective, everything seems to be consistent in terms of color and shape of the objects
                used within the website. Hence, it is an exceptional example in this regard.
