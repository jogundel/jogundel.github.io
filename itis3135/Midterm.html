			<section id="who">
				<h2>About me:</h2>
				<p> My name is Joshua Ogundele and my hobby is cooking various healthy dishes. I was born and raised in Raleigh, North Carolina
                    and I am currently 21 years old. I attended Wake Technical Community College for two years for financial and progressive benefit 
                    purposes. After my two years was accomplished, I decided to move to Charlotte in the Fall of 2022 to attend UNC Charlotte as a junior classified 
                    transfer student to continuously pursue my Bachelors degree in Computer Science.

			<section id="when">
				<h2>When I Started:</h2>
				<p> I started to cook healthy dishes regualrly in the year of 2020 during quarantine. During the pandemic it allowed me to 
                    stay home and conduct more research about many things and I took that opportunity seriously to see what types of healthy foods
                    I could be consuming for health beneficial purposes. This is when I tried quinoa for the first time; which eventually became my 
                    favorite grain dish to implement in my diet to cook. This picture below represents my first well-made quinoa dish.

			<section id="where">
				<h2>Where I do my Hobby:</h2>
				<p> I usually enjoy cooking the most in my own home, however, I would not mind cooking anywhere else especially
                    if food is needed during a particualar moment outside my home along with the right food ingredients provided for me 
                    to cook with. One thing I will admit is the fact that I do cook my best when I am not watched and/or observed by another 
                    individual because there is less pressure put on my shoulders to cook with a great outcome. Cooking in my own home just 
                    gives me a different kind of enjoyment experience! I love playing music while cooking as well because it brings out 
                    the enthusiasm within my personality.

			<section id="how">
				<h2>How I do my Hobby:</h2>
				<p> Initially I stared making my own healthy dishes by following online recipes. Mostly recipes on Youtube, Instagram, and 
					TikTok. I found these resources beneficial, helpful, and easy to follow because I am more of a person who learns best
					through visual representations and through explanations. Thus, it this helped me start. Most importantly, I grew up watching 
					my mother cook numerous recipes so I believe I was aware of a lot of meal preping expectations from her. Moreover, I always ultized
					her presence as an opportunity to learn from my mistakes as a beginner in cooking. Constantly listening to her constructive criticism
					helped me improve over time.

			<section id="why">
				<h2>Why I Started My Hobby:</h2>
				<p> I consider myself as an individual who strongly desires to achieve my fullest potential in all aspects of life; hence, I believe cooking helathy dishes progesses 
					me towards that goal mentally, emotionally, physically, and other important aspects of my life since what one consumes daily has an essentail impact on one's overall well-being. 
					Thus, this is my motivation to cook healthy dishes on a regualr basis.
