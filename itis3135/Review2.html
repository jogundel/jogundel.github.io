                C: From my point of view in a contrast perspective, I believe this website is a good example because the colors used
                on this website is not too bright or dull. The colors used make it easy for the audience to read all the information given 
                within the website. 
                
            </li>
            <li> 
                R: From my point of view in a repititional perspective,  I believe this website is a good example because it does not repeat 
                any unnecessary information. Instead, the consistency is great for the conveinence of the audience to keep up with all detailed 
                information within the NBA. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                A: From my point of view, from an alignment perspective, I believe the alignment is great! Everything is easy to navigate 
                through and nothing seems to be out of place.
            </li>
            <li> 
                P: From my point of view in a proximity perspective, everything seems to be consistent in terms of color and shape of the objects
                used within the website. Hence, it is an exceptional example in this regard.
