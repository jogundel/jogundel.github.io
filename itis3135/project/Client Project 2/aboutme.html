            Greetings to you, I am Martins Ogundele, who is the owner of DT Tax Solutions! I was born and raised in 
            Raleigh, North Carolina and I purused my educational career at North Carolina State University to obtain my 
            Bachelors and Masters degree in Political Science coupled with a concentration in Law and Justice. Outside of filing taxes,
            I am a full time lawyer, thus, I am knowlegdable about majority of the laws, regualations, and/or expectations for U.S. citizens and non U.S. citizens
            within the state of North Carolina. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In regards to my career as a tax preparer, I have been filing taxes for over 10 years now. I have filed taxes for over 5,000 clients within the areas of Raleigh, Cary, Durham, Fayetteville, 
            Holly Springs, Apex, and more cities within the state of North Carolina. Furthermore, over the course of these numerous years of experience with many clients, I have been given many opportunites to 
            sharpen my intellgence, expand my horizon, enhance my communication and learning skills, develop patience, and stregthen my hard working and multi-tasking abilities. 
            Thankfully, after my years of dedication, I am now a certified tax preparer by the United States government owning my own tax office in Raleigh, North Carolina. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I would highly consider myself as a helpful and caring individual who encourages others to succeed by making wise decisions. Hence, as a tax prepare for DT Tax Solutions, this is one of my 
            favorite ways to exploit this characteristic within my personality. Therefore, to say the least, I would highly recommended you to contact me to get your taxes filed on time by me to ensure an affordable, easygoing, and 
            comfortable way to get your taxes filed. 
        </p>
